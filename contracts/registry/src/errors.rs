//! # Registry Contract Error Types
//!
//! Typed error variants for the Fund-My-Cause registry contract.
//!
//! Every state-mutating entry-point returns `Result<_, ContractError>` so that
//! callers receive a structured, machine-readable error code rather than an
//! opaque panic or a silent no-op.
//!
//! ## Error Codes
//!
//! | Code | Variant | Meaning |
//! |------|---------|---------|
//! | 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize()` was called more than once |
//! | 2 | `NotInitialized` | A mutating call was made before `initialize()` |
//! | 3 | `Unauthorized` | Caller did not satisfy the required `require_auth()` check |
//! | 4 | `NotFound` | The requested campaign is not registered |
//! | 5 | `AlreadyRegistered` | The campaign is already in the registry (informational) |
