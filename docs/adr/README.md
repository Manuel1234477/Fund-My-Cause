# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory captures significant architectural decisions made in Fund-My-Cause — what was decided, why, and what alternatives were considered.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a short document that records a single architectural decision. It is **immutable once accepted**: if a decision is reversed, a new ADR supersedes the old one rather than editing it.

## When to write an ADR

Write an ADR when you are making a decision that:

- Is hard or expensive to reverse (on-chain data models, token flows, cross-service contracts)
- Will surprise a future contributor without context
- Involves a trade-off between two or more reasonable alternatives
- Affects more than one layer of the stack (contract + frontend, indexer + API, etc.)

You do **not** need an ADR for routine implementation choices (which library to use for formatting, file naming conventions, etc.).

## How to add a new ADR

1. Copy `template.md` to a new file: `ADR-NNN-short-title.md` (zero-padded, e.g. `ADR-004-fee-model.md`).
2. Fill in every section. Leave `Status: Proposed` until the decision is merged.
3. Open a pull request. Discussion happens on the PR.
4. Once merged, status becomes `Accepted`.
5. If a later ADR supersedes this one, update the `Status` line to `Superseded by ADR-NNN` and add the forward link in the new ADR's `Context` section.
